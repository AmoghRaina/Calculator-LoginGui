# Calculator-LoginGui

**Project Description:**

This repository contains a graphical user interface (GUI) application featuring a calculator and a login page. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It supports decimal inputs and provides a clear button to reset calculations.

The login page offers secure access control, verifying credentials before granting access to the calculator functionality. Successful login changes the status message to indicate success and redirects the user to the calculator interface.
